# ðŸ’³ ATM Interface - Java Console Application

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is a **Java console-based ATM Interface** that allows a user to:
- Register an account
- Log in securely
- Perform banking operations such as:
  - Withdraw funds
  - Deposit money
  - Transfer funds
  - Check balance
  - View transaction history

The program is **menu-driven** and uses `Scanner` for input.  
It simulates an ATM experience entirely in the console.
